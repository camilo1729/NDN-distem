# NDN-distem

* NDN experiments over Distem

This is the procedure to follow in order to repeat the experiments in Grid'5000.

First reserve the nodes with destructive option, because we are going to format =/tmp= directory with =btrfs=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 $ oarsub -t deploy -t destructive -l slash_22=1+nodes=5,walltime=5:00:00 "sleep 1d"
#+END_SRC

We need 4 nodes for deploying =fai1= and 5 nodes for deploying =fai2=.
If we use less machine we will have problems when starting the daemons because of
insufficient memory.
Deploying environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 $ kadeploy3 -f $OAR_NODEFILE -e jessie-x64-nfs -k
#+END_SRC

Executing debootstrap with btrfs options:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 $ distem-bootstrap -g --debian-version jessie -f /tmp/machinefile --enable-admin-network --btrfs-format /dev/sda5
#+END_SRC

In the coordinator node, we need to install the following gems:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ gem install ruby-cute net-scp
#+END_SRC

Cloning the repository in the coordinator node:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ git clone https://github.com/camilo1729/NDN-distem.git
#+END_SRC

Create the file =exp.state.yaml= with the names of all physical machines that are running Distem.
There are too types of topologies:

- =fai1=: dandelion 3-2-4
- =fai2=: dandelion 5-2-20

For building an infrastructure type:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ruby ndn_topo.rb exp.state.yaml fai1.yaml
#+END_SRC

And then start the NDN daemons:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ruby ndn_start.rb fai1.yaml
#+END_SRC
